# Ironhack EDA project

## Dataset

The initial dataset is [Data Science Careers & Salaries 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nalisha/data-science-careers-and-salaries-2025) taken from Kaggle, data collected on Oct 2, 2025 (job posted field uses relative time thus we'll need this date as reference).

Jobs collected from different locations thus salary variability is great, if possible this analysis will use relative salary refering to some base salary in the location.

## Preliminary questions

1. How seniority level and role affect salary
2. How much do skills cost
